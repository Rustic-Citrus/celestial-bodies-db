## Introduction

This project is part of the Relational Database course at freeCodeCamp. As part of the task, I created five tables for a database on celestial bodies: galaxies, nebulae, stars, planets and moons. The simple process of creating the database gave me an appreciation for just how vast the universe is, and how little we really know about it.

## Skills

- Writing a SQL script for PostgreSQL
- Inserting rows into a table
- Creating a database
